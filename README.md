# Hear-It
Motivation:
* Augmenting awareness for the hearing impaired by inducing naturality with the use of keyword recognition through a mobile application.  
* Our idea tries to incorporate the social communication aspect for deaf people in the application which many of the currently existing models fail to address. 
* The purpose of the project is to make deaf people feel more secure and certain of the surroundings and also help them fit better in a social environment.


Findings:
* When the distance between the 2 participants is less than 2 meters, the response time is more or less similar and when the distance is more than that, we can see a significant decrease in response time  using our system over traditional method.
* The application is able to detect the name calls with 88.8% accuracy within a conversation range.
* From the survey we found that 81% of the participants find the  application is reliable.
